to differentiate the parent class and child class
variable we use super keyword

Class A
{
int  x = 100;
}
Class B extends A
{
   int x =200;
    public B(){
    System.out.println(x);
   }
}
class a has x variable and class b has x variable
how to difference this
we create a new Nameless obj or Anonymous object
new B(); when we declare the new obj and access the x variable
it will normally execute the same class x variable of 200
suppose if we want to access the class A x value of 100 How?
we have super keyword in
 int x = 200;
 public B (){
 System.out.println(super.x);
 }
 so, super keyword here print the A class x variable which is 100

//super keyword is useful when super class variable or method in subclass variable or method is having conflict
// we use super keyword which one to print we have to use super keyword

super keyword can be used in 3 ways in java:

1)to call the super class variable
   When ever super class variable name and sub class variable name both are same
   and if we create an object for the sub class
to call the super class method
to call the super class Constructor
